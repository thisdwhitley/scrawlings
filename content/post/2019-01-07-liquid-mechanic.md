It is probably perspective, but I feel like I'm in the yard ***ALL*** the time.
So that makes my yard equipment very important.  My best yard friend
([my backpack blower](https://amzn.to/2CU7i2W)) was not feeling right so here's
what I did to fix it back up.<!--more-->

### BACKGROUND

Out of all the equipment I use in the yard, I use my
[blower](https://amzn.to/2CU7i2W) by ***FAR*** the most.  This is largely
because I am constantly in an *unwinnable war* against the leaves in the yard.
And I understand that small engines are probably not meant to be run at 100% for
very long periods of time.  But I run that thing full blast for a few hours a
few days a week.  You could say that I abuse it and you wouldn't be wrong.  

It is also my **favorite** piece of yard equipment (*as a side note and maybe as
something I should investigate further...it is the only piece of equipment I
purchased new*).  So I was really disappointed and my feelings were hurt when it
started acting up.  It is hard to describe, but it felt like it wanted to cut
off sometimes when I had it running full blast.  It also took longer to warm up.
And the motor sort of "cut" and kept jerking on my back.  There is probably an
explanation (as well as more descriptive words) for all of that, but I blamed it
on the fact that I didn't do any maintenance on the machine (I had winterized it
in previous years but neglected to do so this year).  

So I accepted the fact that I would have to put in some quality time with it.
But when I went to get out my tools I saw that I had purchased some
"[Mechanic In A Bottle](https://amzn.to/2Rwc5jm)" for an old mower I was trying
to get working.  I followed the instructions and let the
[blower](https://amzn.to/2CU7i2W) run while I took a look at (**and ended up
breaking**) my lawn mower (be on the lookout for a post about that).

After a few minutes, the [blower](https://amzn.to/2CU7i2W) was purring like a
kitten.  There might be magic in that bottle.

### NEXT STEPS

* See how long this band-aide lasts
* Review my [Husqvarna 350BT](https://amzn.to/2CU7i2W) blower because I love it

---

### SIDE NOTES

* I've been meaning to mention the numerous battles in the unwinnable war that
  comes with a large yard in an old neighborhood, the stupid leaves are just one
  battle

---

### WHAT I LEARNED

* Sometimes not throwing stuff away (also known as "being a packrat") has its
  advantages
* Breaking the lawn mower was stupid
* Also, I should take better care of all of my equipment

### SHORT VERSION

To avoidÂ **tl;dr** enjoy this instead:

* Try some [Mechanic In A Bottle](https://amzn.to/2Rwc5jm) before committing to
  all the time of taking apart the engine!
