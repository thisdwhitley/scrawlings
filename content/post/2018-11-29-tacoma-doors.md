I'm pretty sure I need to replace the actuators that lock my Tacoma doors and
from what I can tell, it is no small task.<!--more-->

### BACKGROUND

Some time ago, the driver's door on my 2009 Toyota Tacoma began working only
some of the time.  This was made obvious when the truck refused to *BEEP* when
using the keyless entry.  It got more and more regular until it simply never
worked anymore.  This was annoying, but I figured, I have the key **right in my
hand** so I resorted to just unlocking the door with the key, and locking the
door with my hand as I exited the truck.  No big deal.

But recently, the passenger side back door is exhibiting a similar behavior.
Truth be told, I don't know how long this has been going on because it does not
effect the *BEEP*, it simply does or does not lock.  ***SIDE NOTE:*** *the first
time I noticed this was when I made a lot of fun of my mom who was sitting back
there and couldn't get out because the door was locked ...sorry mom.*

This is a little more disconcerting and will ultimately force me to get this
fixed.

### UPDATE: 2019-01-12

I completed the passenger back door today!  I was really anticipating getting
hung up and it being a real pain and, actually, failing.  I had allocated an
entire day of frustration and pain, but it was completed in about 2.5 hours (I
actually cut the grass *maybe too late in the season* between the time I took
the actuator out and when I replaced the motor).

I absolutely could not have done it without the
[video](https://youtu.be/FZCeeUWMTcY) but would like to add the following notes:

- the video is awesome, and at one point even states how many screws you'll need
  to undo once the actuator is out.  Unfortunately, that sort of foresight is
  not provided when you're actually taking the panel off.  In all fairness, the
  video author does state that most Tacoma owners probably already know how to
  take the door panel off.  *Apparently I am not most Tacoma owners* which is
  disappointing.  For future reference, there are ***8*** clips holding the door
  in place.  Even with that knowledge, there's a good chance I would have broken
  some of them.  But in my case, I broke off 4 of the 8.  Whoops.  And it really
  sort of sucked because not only did I have to buy more, but it was tough to
  get the busted ones out.  I used
  [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEjVd_Gscbc) method to get the busted
  ones out.
- getting the actuator body back into place is...horrible.  If I'm being honest,
  I don't even know how I got it out, after monkey-ing with it, it eventually
  sort of plopped out.  But getting it back in place probably took more time
  than any other part of this project.  I wish I could provide some solid advice
  on the best method to get it back in place, but I just wrestled with it.  I
  can't say for sure what the best method is.  Just expect some time at that
  part of the project.
- I purchased this [auto trim removal set](https://amzn.to/2VM6t3D) but really
  didn't use it.  This **might** explain the busted clips, but I don't want to
  think so.
- ***I still need to do the driver side front door...***

### SOLUTION

Most of what I've [read](https://www.tacomaworld.com/threads/bad-door-lock-actuators.198658/#post-4459316)
[online](https://www.tacomaworld.com/threads/another-door-lock-actuator-patch-thread.254593/)
tend to point at the actuators in the door locks.  I have not taken the truck to
a shop to inquire about the repair, but most of those same articles indicate
that having it fixed by a pro is super expensive.  Naturally I won't be doing
that.

I have found a pretty detailed [video](https://youtu.be/FZCeeUWMTcY) of doing
this work on the back door.  The page also notes that the part is a **20mm flat
shaft actuator motor** and can be found on ebay (sold by zinsky) or
[Amazon](https://amzn.to/2KFB2CW).

### NEXT STEPS

* Purchase the parts and dedicate some time to do this

### SIDE NOTES

* The comments in the video are very insightful and should be read in their
entirety.  They indicate that the driver side door is going to be a bit of a
different process...
* While I have to door panels off, I should also consider repairing the cracked
  armrest:
