I'm pretty sure I need to replace the actuators that lock my Tacoma doors and
from what I can tell, it is no small task.<!--more-->

### BACKGROUND

Some time ago, the driver's door on my 2009 Toyota Tacoma began working only
some of the time.  This was made obvious when the truck refused to *BEEP* when
using the keyless entry.  It got more and more regular until it simply never
worked anymore.  This was annoying, but I figured, I have the key **right in my
hand** so I resorted to just unlocking the door with the key, and locking the
door with my hand as I exited the truck.  No big deal.

But recently, the passenger side back door is exhibiting a similar behavior.
Truth be told, I don't know how long this has been going on because it does not
effect the *BEEP*, it simply does or does not lock.  ***SIDE NOTE:*** *the first
time I noticed this was when I made a lot of fun of my mom who was sitting back
there and couldn't get out because the door was locked ...sorry mom.*

This is a little more disconcerting and will ultimately force me to get this
fixed.

### SOLUTION

Most of what I've [read](https://www.tacomaworld.com/threads/bad-door-lock-actuators.198658/#post-4459316)
[online](https://www.tacomaworld.com/threads/another-door-lock-actuator-patch-thread.254593/)
tend to point at the actuators in the door locks.  I have not taken the truck to
a shop to inquire about the repair, but most of those same articles indicate
that having it fixed by a pro is super expensive.  Naturally I won't be doing
that.

I have found a pretty detailed [video](https://youtu.be/FZCeeUWMTcY) of doing
this work on the back door.  The page also notes that the part is a **20mm flat
shaft actuator motor** and can be found on ebay (sold by zinsky) or
[Amazon](https://amzn.to/2KFB2CW).

### NEXT STEPS

* Purchase the parts and dedicate some time to do this

### SIDE NOTES

* The comments in the video are very insightful and should be read in their
entirety.  They indicate that the driver side door is going to be a bit of a
different process...
* While I have to door panels off, I should also consider repairing the cracked
  armrest:
