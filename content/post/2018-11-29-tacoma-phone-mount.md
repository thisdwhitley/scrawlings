It is time to clean up all the wires coming out of the dash and stop trying to
constantly balance a phone in my lap.<!--more-->

### BACKGROUND

My Tacoma is a 2009 (2nd Gen) model.  I love it.  I replaced the stock head unit
almost immediately after purchasing (with a
[Pioneer AVIC-F700BT](https://www.pioneerelectronics.com/PUSA/Car/GPS-Navigation/AVIC-F700BT)).
At that time (2008), luxuries such as Android Auto just weren't a thing.  I did
my best with what I had and souped it up so that I could use my iPod to listen
to music while it was tucked into my center console.  I could even control it
with the steering wheel controls.  It was awesome.

But now it is dated.

The adapter I had for the iPod connectivy doesn't connect to anything anymore
and even the technology in the head unit doesn't recognize most technologies of
today.  So I end up plugging a 3.5mm jack from a source into an input in the
*front* of the head unit.  It is super ugly to have that hanging off my dash
***at all times*** but I work with what I've got and I don't think even having
a mount will fix that (I'll research what I did to get the iPod connection in
the back, but I tend to think that the converter isn't made for common
connections because the unit is over 10 yrs old...).

In addition to it being unsightly, I'm pretty sure having to balance whatever is
playing music in my lap has rendered my balls useless.

Because of some unfortunate events and horribly timing (long story) I actually
have 2 functional and not-too-old phones.  Because the new one does not have a
headphone jack (which pisses me ***right*** off), I've been using the older one
as a "car" phone which I use to play downloaded music.  I can also enable my
actual phone as a hotspot and connect to it to stream music and navigate with
the old phone that does not have cellular service (the GPS maps on my 10yr old
head unit are very much worthless at this point).

Pretty neat idea, but I still end up with wires everywhere and now balancing
multiple phones which are frying my balls.  So I need to come up with a way to
mount at least one of these.

### SOLUTION

As usual, the awesome folks at [TacomaWorld](https://www.tacomaworld.com/) have
a lot of great suggestions.  But I think I'll be doing something very similar to
[MOD: A-Pillar RAM mount GPS/Phone holder](https://www.tacomaworld.com/threads/mod-a-pillar-ram-mount-gps-phone-holder.372250/).
That seems to get the phone out of my view while not blocking a vent.  I'll
likely need to re-run some wiring, but if I make one of the ports right below
this a USB port that will help (search the entire 40x pages for fuse tap and USB
port recommendations).

### NEXT STEPS

* Sort throught the thread to figure out what parts are necessary
* Purchase the [parts](https://amzn.to/2TTUr7s) and dedicate time to do this

---

### SIDE NOTES

* I originally considered replacing the head unit with something more modern.  I
  still think this is a good approach, but the mounting solution I'm looking at
  implementing is a couple hundred dollars less expensive and I am cheap.
