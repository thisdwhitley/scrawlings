I don't know about you, but I am tired of waking up to realize that my phone had
not charged all night.  Turns out, the fix is pretty easy.<!--more-->

If you do not care to read (or about) all the words and explanations, feel free
to skip to the [SHORT VERSION](#tldr)

### BACKGROUND

I charge my phone every night.  I don't know if I should, and I certainly don't
need to, but I do.  Habit I guess.  Well lately I just haven't been able to plug
in my charger well.  That sounds silly, but I could really tell that I had to
jam it in extra hard and it did not seem to *catch*.  All too often the cord
would fall out at the lightest touch.

This was ***very*** frustrating, especially when the cord had fallen out and I
didn't realize it.  Ending up in a phone that wasn't fully charged in the
morning.

### SOLUTION

This turned out to be embarrassingly simple to mitigate.  I straightened out a
staple, [I really needed something *tiny* and I couldn't find a needle or a pin
(because I didn't look hard)] and just shoved it into the USB-C port on my phone
and drug it around.  The amount of dust that I dredged out of there was
astounding.  I really couldn't believe the mountain of dust and lint that came
out.

I thought to myself that **that** had to be what was causing the charging cord
to not go in adequately.  So I excitedly tried to plug the cord in and it still
didn't *catch* and I was pissed.  But I knew I had to have made progress so I
started again with the staple.  ***Even more dust and lint came out!***  

This time the resultant pile was [K2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K2) to the
previous [Everest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Everest).  And now the
plug and port work like I remember them working when I first got the phone.

### NEXT STEPS

* now that I know that dust and lint get jammed in there I should be more
  careful, but I'm exceedingly linty (based on my bellybutton collection center)
  and so I'll just have to keep it in mind

---

### SIDE NOTES

* I was ready to give up on this phone and USB-C altogether because I can
  remember my last phone doing the same thing
* I am pretty sure it cannot be good for any electrical device to have a piece
  of metal scraped along the contacts used for charging...so remember my
  [disclaimer](/page/disclosure)

### WHAT I LEARNED

* my phone collects a lot of dust and lint in my pocket

### REFERENCE

* N/A

### SHORT VERSION

To avoidÂ **tl;dr** enjoy this instead:

* Use something very small to dredge out your USB-C port (I used a staple)
