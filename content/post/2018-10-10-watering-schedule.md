Well the yard was aerated and re-seeded yesterday.  I set up all my hoses and
sprinklers...let's see if we can get a yard established this year.<!--more-->

### BACKGROUND

As I've discussed in other posts, I'm basically starting over this year in my
yard.  It was aerated and re-seeded yesterday.

#### Watering Schedule

Based on Turf Titanz recommendation of:

> For the best results, seeds will require light and frequent watering (Twice a
day for at least 3 weeks). Just enough to keep the seeds wet.

I have interpreted that as:

<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;width:50%;}
.tg td{padding:5px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:grey;}
.tg th{font-weight:bold;padding:5px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:grey;background-color:silver;}
.tg .tg-c3ow{border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:top}
.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
</style>
<table class="tg" align="center">
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-0pky">Zone 1 [left side]</th>
    <th class="tg-c3ow">Cycle A</th>
    <th class="tg-c3ow">Cycle B</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">Start Water (time)</td>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">06:00</td>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">12:00</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">How Long (mins)</td>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">15</td>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">15</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-0pky">Zone 2 [right side]</th>
    <th class="tg-c3ow">Cycle A</th>
    <th class="tg-c3ow">Cycle B</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">Start Water (time)</td>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">06:15</td>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">12:15</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">How Long (mins)</td>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">15</td>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">15</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-0pky">Zone 3 [left ditch]</th>
    <th class="tg-c3ow">Cycle A</th>
    <th class="tg-c3ow">Cycle B</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">Start Water (time)</td>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">06:30</td>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">12:30</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">How Long (mins)</td>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">15</td>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">15</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-0pky">Zone 4 [right ditch]</th>
    <th class="tg-c3ow">Cycle A</th>
    <th class="tg-c3ow">Cycle B</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">Start Water (time)</td>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">06:45</td>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">12:45</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">How Long (mins)</td>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">15</td>

  </tr>

### NEXT STEPS

At this point all I can do is wait.  After I confirm that this second cycle
actually works today, I might turn off the water for the next few days because
I'm fairly certain we will get rain until Friday (2018-10-12) thanks to
[Hurricane Michael](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article219724340.html)
.

I will turn the water back on Friday afternoon to ensure the seeds get water
even if I am out of town.

I will keep this watering schedule until October 31st, 2018.  At which time I
will increase the time of each watering, but only do it once a day.

### SIDE NOTES

* I am not convinced that the entire yard was "slit seeded."  I say this because
  the machine that I *think* was doing this kept getting caught up in the mesh/
  webbing from the roll-out hay Turf Titanz used before.  This stuff caused me a
  bunch of headaches all season.  I think only a few passes were made in the
  area closest to the house.  I will be curious to see if this gets the best
  results (and I will be pretty pissed if it does).
* During the slit seeding, the guy pulled up a metal bar that Turf Titanz had
  left in the yard.  It was part of the roll-out hay and I had no idea it was
  there but I'm surprised it was not removed when they rolled that shit out
  initially.
* I was told that 1# of Nitrogen was applied today but I sure didn't see that if
  it happened.  **DISCLAIMER:** I don't know what that even looks like so
  *hopefully* it was mixed in with the seed...
