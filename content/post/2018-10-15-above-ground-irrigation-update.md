After a few days of watering I've found the system insufficient in the ditch
area.  So, naturally, I've ordered more parts to address this...<!--more-->

### BACKGROUND

I found that having any combination of oscillating sprinklers in series in the
hopes of covering roughly 75' length of ditch area just didn't cut it.  I
understand that it is a lot to ask, I mean, that is 200' of hose just to *GET*
to the first sprinkler.  

The result is that the sprinklers just sort of spit water and don't cover the
entire area that I need (side note: this actually works for the shorter ditch
area).  So I was forced to figure out a better way to cover the area which is
(very) roughly a 75'x20' rectangle (this is really just a guess).

### Solution

I ***ditched*** (see what I did there) the
[Melnor XT Turbo Oscillating Sprinkler](https://amzn.to/2A4k65x) and ended up
using a Hunter setup sort of mimicking
[Ryan Knorr's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGmz1qSJjvBPluouoOj1Qkg) setup.

Here is another list of supplies to cover this area:

1. [Hunter MP300090 3-Pack Rotator Spray Nozzle](https://amzn.to/2Sj0y4u) 
   ~ **$22**
2. [Hunter Pop-Up Sprinkler PROS04CV](https://amzn.to/2qd48jS) = 3x$9 ~ **$27**
3. [Rain Bird Spray Head Riser](https://amzn.to/2D3Slg9) = 3x$1.50 ~ **$4.50**
4. [3 Pack - Orbit Sprinkler Spike Base](https://amzn.to/2CImeBR) ~ **$14**

I am *very* happy with this setup.  I mentioned before that the Hunter MP
Rotator heads did not provide the coverage I need in my main yard, but they are
just about perfect for this application.

They **DO** provide less water at a time (allowing further distance) so I had to
modify my watering schedule.

### NEXT STEPS

Now that I've got a bunch 2x 100' hoses and the 2x more 50' hoses I've got quite
a bit of hose coiled up at each endpoint.  So I'm going to explore cutting the
hose to the correct [length](https://amzn.to/2CD06IV)...

### SIDE NOTES

* I previously purchased the
[Hunter MP3000360 MP Rotator Nozzle](https://amzn.to/2ELG8OQ) as noted above,
and it'd probably work ok if I didn't need such a large coverage area with so
little water pressure
