I wrote [previously]({{< ref "2018-11-29-tacoma-doors.md" >}}) about the need to
fix my truck doors so that they actually lock when I think they lock.  I tackled
the driver door over the weekend, here are some notes.<!--more-->

### BACKGROUND

As I updated in the original [post]({{< ref "2018-11-29-tacoma-doors.md" >}}),
to my surprise, I actually succeeded in taking apart the back door, removing the
actuator body, and dissecting it to replace the actuator motor.  Maybe what was
even more surprising is that I was successful in getting it *back in the truck*
and it *actually* ***worked!***

In the nature of full disclosure, I absolutely could **NOT** have done this were
it not for the awesome [video by Tony Manriquez](https://youtu.be/FZCeeUWMTcY).
For the back door I just watched the video, paused it, did it myself, and
continued until I was done.  I couldn't believe it, but I did it.

Well, that gave me the confidence to tackle the driver door and, boy, was that
confidence ***misplaced!***  I had read in the very helpful comments that the
driver side door was a bit different and basically begging the author to create
another video for the driver door.  It did not take long for me to realize just
how different things were.  There were a few times I wanted to cry as I kept
thinking about how much this pure [HUBRIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubris)
was going to cost me.

In the end, I prevailed, but there were some real uncomfortable times so I
thought I'd share some observations.  I failed to capture it in video and I only
have a few pictures, but hopefully this will help someone.

### CHALLENGES

#### CHALLENGE #1: initial differences

I could see right away after taking the driver's door panel off that this door
was different than the back door.  Of note:

1. this door has a key lock on the handle which results in a bit of a more
   complicated actuator housing and more/tougher connections
2. this door has a more elaborate control panel for windows and locks
3. the 10mm bolt connecting the bottom of the window track is right out in the
   open (as opposed to behind a seal on the back door)
3. the "dressing" at the top of this panel is a "sail", not the larger trim
   piece on the back door

##### SOLUTION #1

I wasn't freaking out yet, here is how I addressed these challenges:

1. I took a lot of pictures before removing the actuator body/housing from the
   door, hoping they'd be helpful in putting it back in place
2. I watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjhYKzE_yBg) on removing
   this panel and so I knew I could just pop this panel off and unplug it.  This
   time I actually used the [auto trim removal set](https://amzn.to/2VM6t3D)
   even though I could have probably gotten away not using it. (*after seeing
   how easy this was, I'm forced to wonder if I could have taken the window
   control "panel" off the back door before removing it...it was tough to reach
   the wire clip between the door and the panel*)
3. based on my success on the back door, I was confident enough to just start
   removing bolts (...hubris) and it was easy enough to find the right one:

     {{< figure src="/img/2019-01-20-tacoma-doors-front/door.png" caption="here it is" >}}
   {{< /gallery >}}
4. this sail just popped right off

#### CHALLENGE #2: the actuator body is completely different

When I finally mangled the actuator body out of the door cavity, it was clear
pretty quickly that it was very different.  I am guessing that that is because
these front doors have locks in the doors and so maybe it just requires the
motor to be positioned differently.

##### SOLUTION #2

I found that, similar to the back door actuator, this shell/body also had a
total of 7 screws.  I removed these screws and pried apart tabs holding the
"clamshell" together, just like before.  When I opened it up, it was totally
different.  There were pins in the motor that I need to get to!  Those pins were
attached to a piece of plastic that it looked like I could remove.  So I removed
an additional 3 screws from it and gently pulled it out.  I was able to remove
the motor from the pins and the auger and replaced it with a new one and
carefully closed everything back up.

*NOTE: there was some sort of blue lever behind a fragile looking piece of
metal...I just tried very hard to not touch those and tried to slide it back in
position when done...it must have worked!* ***LUCKY!***

  {{< figure src="/img/2019-01-20-tacoma-doors-front/extra-plastic-piece.png" caption="here is the extra plastic piece and the 3 screws I removed" >}}

***I was totally winging it here!***

#### CHALLENGE #4: connecting the lock from the handle to the actuator body

### NEXT STEPS

* list of next steps

---

### SIDE NOTES

* what I have referred to as a "actuator body" throughout is called either a
  "Lock Actuator," "Door Lock Actuator Motor," or simply "Lock Assembly" by
  Toyota.  I think the part numbers are as follows:
  * rear door: [69050-04020](https://amzn.to/2FLFOiH)
  * front door: [69040-04030](https://amzn.to/2DxxhO8)
* the approach here was, instead of replacing that whole "body," I took that
  thing apart and just replaced the part that was broken, the
  [motor](https://amzn.to/2FPz838) (same motor fits both "bodies")

### WHAT I LEARNED

* I should learn something in each post

### REFERENCE

<div id="tldr"></div>

* to take the driver panel off, I referred to this related
  [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjhYKzE_yBg)...I *had* to watch it a
  few times...

### SHORT VERSION

To avoidÂ **tl;dr** enjoy this instead:

this will usually be code
