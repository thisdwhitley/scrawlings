Well I hate to think that I failed at establishing a yard last year, but I did.
The only thing that could make me feel a little bit better is if I was at least
able to ***LEARN*** from that experience.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure I have...
<!--more-->

### BACKGROUND

I really thought that I was going to have a good yard last year, and really, I
*almost* did, it was almost respectable.

But, it all died and I'm left with weeds (not just crab grass, other, exotic
weeds too).

### WHAT I LEARNED

So, in my effort to identify a lesson from last year, I have come
up with (I'm no expert, but this is what I'm going with):

#### LESSON 1

> I did not treat for fungus (because I'm cheap and it was ~$400) and
[brown patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_patch) wiped me out.

In order to address this "lesson," I have started a
[Turf Management Plan](https://turftitanz.com/services/turf-management-plans/)
with [Turf Titanz](http://turftitanz.com).

#### LESSON 2

> I relied too much on *hoping* that the rain was sufficient for watering
(basically I think I stopped watering too early in the season...)

In order to address this second "lesson," I have purchased the a bunch of stuff
in an attempt to take the thinking (and most of the effort) out of watering the
grass:

##### PURCHASED

1. 700' of cheapo hose = **~$135**
2. [Melnor 4 zone / 4 cycle Watering timer](https://amzn.to/2pNteFu) = **$50**
3. [Melnor XT Turbo Oscillating Sprinkler](https://amzn.to/2A4k65x) = **$20**
4. [Melnor Metal Pulsating Sprinkler with Tripod](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E3VRVLI/ref=od_aui_detailpages01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
   = **~$35**
5. [2-Way Garden Hose Splitter ](https://amzn.to/2pPjTNr) = **$7**
6. [Galvanized Ground Garden Staples](https://amzn.to/2ybLwFo) = **$10**

##### ALREADY HAD

Those were purchased to supplement the following items that I had from last
year:

- 250' of hose (also cheapo)
- [2-Way Garden Hose Splitter ](https://amzn.to/2pPjTNr)
- [2 nice sprinklers](https://amzn.to/2QI0Q3c), [1 cheapo one](https://amzn.to/2A4QHrQ)
- [1 tripod sprinkler](https://amzn.to/2pN5bH5) (I'm going to need two for the coverage in the front yard)

### CONCERNS

With all of that said, I have some real concerns and items to consider:

1. I am on a well, so while the water is free, I absolutely *can not* deplete
   the entire well of water at any point
2. Because I'm on a well, I have a [Kinetico](https://www.kinetico.com) system
   to treat my water.  Water to all of the exterior spigots go through this
   system (which makes about ZERO sense) so I will want to run the hose directly
   from the well
3. I do not know the appropriate time of day, nor duration to water
4. My septic system (and therefore leaching field) is in the front yard, and I
   think that I read you can't have an actual in-ground irrigation system put
   over a leaching field...I hope I didn't make that up because I'm cheap.

### SIDE NOTE

I was initially very excited about
[some youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGmz1qSJjvBPluouoOj1Qkg)
and so I purchased some of the same equipment.  As luck would have it, I needed
to cover almost exactly a 30' radius and the parts I got were supposed to do
that.  Unfortunately, perhaps due to water pressure or distance to the
sprinklers, they just did not accomplish what I needed.  

So I basically wasted that money (~$50) and abandoned that in lieu of leaving
the tower sprinklers in my yard all season long...my neck is red.
