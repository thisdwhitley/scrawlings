I am admittedly a packrat.  And when I saw that someone left a Honda mower on
the curbside, I couldn't resist taking it.<!--more-->

If you do not care to read (or about) all the words and explanations, feel free
to skip to the [SHORT VERSION](#tldr)

### BACKGROUND

I actually spoke with the previous owner.  He mentioned that it starts and runs
just fine, but that it no longer self propels.  I told him that I needed the
excercise, but really knowing that *with the power of the internet*, ***I CAN
FIX ANYTHING!***  We'll just have to see at what cost...

The prior owner noted that it had been stored outside for the last 2 months, and
so it was soaked since it has been raining pretty constantly for at LEAST 2
months.  I only bring that up because I was not able to start it...

It is a
[HRR2164TDA: MZCG-7700001 through 7799999](http://cdn.powerequipment.honda.com/pe/pdf/manuals/31VL0U20.pdf).
I have not done a lot of research into this model but I do not suspect that is a
top of the line model.  But I always hear that Honda makes some of the best
lawn mowers.  On that note, I have 1 completely busted and another mostly busted
Honda mower in my shed.  Now I have a third that doesn't work...YET!

### CHALLENGE

* The first challenge will be to get this mower cleaned up and starting.

---

### SIDE NOTES

* It is hard to associate a cost to the time and effort I'm going to put into
  this "free" mower

---

### WHAT I LEARNED

* It pays to pay attention to free stuff

---

### REFERENCE

<div id="tldr"></div>

* N/A

---

### SHORT VERSION

To avoidÂ **tl;dr** enjoy this instead:

* I got a free mower which I will undoubtedly sink a lot of time to get running
