If you've ever seen my yard it probably doesn't need to be said, but **I don't
know what I'm doing**.  That was made very clear this year.  After removing 17
trees and having it graded and seeded last year (with tall fescue) there were
moments of pride as the grass started showing up.

There used to be a forest there, now it looked like an actual yard.

But it never looked great.  There were bare spots that I even had re-seeded but
grass just never grew.  Long-story-short: all the grass died off.  I ended up
with a yard of mainly weeds.

So today I ran the mower over the weeds, hopefully for the last time of the
season.  I also dug up one of the bare spots.  It was weird because the ground
was soft there and so I just dug at all the soft section which left a larger
hole than I expected.  I filled it back up with the cheapest topsoil I could
purchase (which looked almost *IDENTICAL* to the soil I removed).  Not only does
the soil I replaced look almost identical, it feels the same spongy way after
filling it back in...

Turf Titanz will be here on Tuesday to aerate and overseed.  I will basically be
starting from scratch.
