I change the (pre) filter in our Kinetico Super Kit fairly regularly, here are the steps I follow and a list of times I've completed this.<!--more-->

### BACKGROUND

We are on a well and so I was convinced we needed a water treatment system.  I
should discuss this in a different post, but suffice it to say that having water
treatment comes with some maintenance.

---

### STEPS

1. Make room by moving salt bin and getting buckets
2. Turn Softener valve to *YELLOW*
3. Place tube in bucket
4. Turn tube valve on tube to be parallel with tube (**OPEN**)
5. Turn valve on front to be vertical (**OPEN**)
6. Wait for water to stop draining
7. Remove housing and filter (hang red bucket where housing was)
8. Lube up new filter and clean housing
9. Replace filter then housing
10. Turn tube valve perpendicular to tube (**CLOSED**)
11. Turn front valve horizontal (**CLOSED**)
12. Turn main valve slowly to *GREEN*

### COMPLETED

* 2018-10-14
* 2018-08-13
* 2018-04-14
* 2018-02-01

(I was told to change this every 6 months initially.  Then I told Kinetico how
dirty it was each time and they recommended every 4 months.  It was still filthy
every time I changed it so I was told to do it every 2 months.  It is still very
dirty every time...which has led me to flush the neautralizer routinely as well)
