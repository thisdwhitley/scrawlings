### DISCLOSURE POLICY

Whenever possible, the posts in this site contain affiliate links.  If you click
on an affiliate link and make a qualifying purchase, the site owner will receive
a very small commission.  This does **NOT** result in additional charges to you
or cost you anything.  

thisdwhitley participates in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an
affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn
advertising fees by advertising and linking to
[Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2CWd3xc).  And while this might be geared towards
advertising, the only reason it would appear on this site is if it is something
I'd use and endorse.

Mentions of associated products/services/businesses within the content of this
site may or may not be noted as an affiliate link in every reference, but you
should assume that it is.  It is unlikely that the site owner will earn any
substantial affiliate money, but any proceeds will go to keeping this site up
and running.  And for that, ***THANK YOU***.
